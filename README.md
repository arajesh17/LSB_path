## Lateral Skull Base Pre-operative Planning

This repository contains the code used for lateral skull base preoperative planning as part of the manuscript: [Automated objective surgical planning for lateral skull base tumors](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11548-022-02564-9#citeas).

The code takes .nrrd segmentation files and computes the surgical paths based on the craniotomy borders defined by the user. It also outputs the relative morbidity of the approaches.
